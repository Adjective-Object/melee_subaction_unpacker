Trying to figure out meaning of joint flags
can't rule out the idea of bone numbering for hitboxes?

these binary values are from a bitset of the number,
after it has been converted to host endianness

Some Fox Bones:

1d7d8: 00010000000000000000000000001001 left ear
1d998: 00010000000000000000000000001001 right ear
1d768: 00010000000001010000000010001001 head
1d6f8: 00010000000000000000000000001001 neck

1ced8: 00010000000000000000000000001001 lower torso
1cf48: 00010000000000000000000000001001 upper torso

1c668: 00010000000001010000000110001110 bone 0
1c6d8: 00010000000000000000000000001001 bone 0 -> torso
1c748: 00010000000000000000000000001001 ball joint at end of bone 0 -> torso connection
1c7b8: 00010000000000000000000000001001 ecb bottom bone?
1c828: 00010000000000000000000000001001 lowest torso?


I can't think of any common properties among these bones
